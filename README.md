## About this Notebook
This is my submission for the project component of the Web Services and Applications module.

The web service in this project is called 'Team Task Tracker' and provides basic CRUD capabilities for web users to keep track of tasks.

To run the service, 'python rest_server.py' should be run in command prompt and the website should be accessed via URL: http://127.0.0.1:5000/ 

There, users can update a list of tasks, who the task is assigned to and whether that task is complete. This can be done on the front end (ie. on the website) or via Postman.
